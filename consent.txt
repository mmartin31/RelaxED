The purpose of this Quality Improvement (QI) project is to increase the education
and community awareness of anxiety disorders to bring support and treatment to
those who are affected by anxiety. Providing support to those in rural communities
can lead to improved health outcomes for women, thus better outcomes for families.

As a participant in the project, you will be asked to utilize the mobile app to search
local resources and read through the educational module. Once this is completed, there
is a survey that includes five questions with multiple choice answers that can be reached
via the app or by QR code on the flyer given. If you do not feel comfortable answering
questions in the survey you can stop at any time. No personal or identifying information
will be asked.

It is anticipated that the project will require about __30-45__minutes of your time.
